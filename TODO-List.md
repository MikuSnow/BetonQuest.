# TODO List

The changes marked as done will appear in the next version. The ones on top describe what I am working on and the rest needs to be done.

* [ ] Creating objectives directly from event, without referencing the objectives.yml file (it is unneeded complication as there can always be exactly one event for every objective)
* [ ] Denizen support (mainly for firing events but I'll try to add checking conditions in scripts (useful for points and tags))
* [ ] MythicMobs support (and mob name support in MobKill objective, why not?)
* [ ] Regex checking of condition/event/objective instruction string syntax (to easily catch every error)
* [ ] Optionally requiring specific responses in chat during conversations (for riddles and stuff)
* [ ] Potion brewing objective (kinda hard to do or I'm stupid) (yeah, probably the second one...)
* [ ] Put item in chest objective (for crazy Skyrim-like delivery quests (eg. food for Greybeards))
* [ ] Logging errors to the file
* [ ] GUI or in-game, chat-based editor (it will take a while)
