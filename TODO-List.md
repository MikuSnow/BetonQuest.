# TODO List

* [X] Conversations divided into multiple files (one per conversation)
* [X] NPCs from blocks shoud be available with Citizens enabled
* [X] Fix conversations manually starting again even though already started by an event
* [X] Event command (for firing events)
* [X] Kill NPC objective (at budopey's request)
* [X] Set Block event (mainly for activating redstone)
* [ ] Regex checking of condition/event/objective instruction string syntax (to easily catch every error)
* [X] Location for Action objective (this would check location of a block, unlike location condition which checks player's location)
* [ ] Optionally requiring specific responses in chat during conversations (for riddles and stuff)
* [X] Unified item list in separate file (these would be referenced in several events and conditions)
* [X] Book title and text support, potion types support (in that item list)
* [ ] Book reading objective (it could start quests, just like in Skyrim)
* [ ] Potion brewing objective (kinda hard to do or I'm stupid) (yeah, probably the second one...)
* [ ] Put item in chest objective (for crazy Skyrim-like delivery quests (eg. food for Greybeards))
* [ ] Logging errors to the file
* [X] Updater (why not?)
* [ ] GUI or in-game, chat-based editor (it will take a while)
