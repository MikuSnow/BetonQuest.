# TODO List

The changes marked as done will appear in the next version. The ones on top describe what I am working on and the rest needs to be done.

* [ ] Titles as a message about updating a journal (for 1.8)
* [ ] Validation of input in conditions/events/objectives
* [ ] Optionally requiring specific responses in chat during conversations (for riddles and stuff)
* [ ] Potion brewing objective (kinda hard to do or I'm stupid) (yeah, probably the second one...)
* [ ] Put item in chest objective (for crazy Skyrim-like delivery quests (eg. food for Greybeards))
* [ ] Logging errors to the file
* [ ] GUI or in-game, chat-based editor (it will take a while)
* [ ] Denizen support (may take a long time, I hate Denizen...)
