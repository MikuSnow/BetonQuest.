# Contributing

**TODO list have been moved to [Issues](https://github.com/Co0sh/BetonQuest/issues). [These things](https://github.com/Co0sh/BetonQuest/issues?q=milestone%3A"1.7+version"+) will appear in 1.7 version.**

Do you like my work here? There are some ways you can help to make this plugin even better.

## New ideas

Need something? Or just have a brilliant idea? Head to the [Issues](https://github.com/Co0sh/BetonQuest/issues) and create new one. Just remember to start the title with uppercase letter or I will edit it!

## Bug reports

Found a bug? Great, create new [issue](https://github.com/Co0sh/BetonQuest/issues) so I can fix it in the next version!

## Contributing code

If you know Java and Bukkit you can take some issue and create pull request. Just let me know and remember these few things:

* The contributed code must be well tested and working (you don't say?)
* Use only spaces for indentation: 4 spaces instead of regular tab.
* Wrap your code at 100th column (most of the code should be wrapped).
* Comment everything so the code is easy to understand for everyone.
* Use block comments to document classes, methods and fields.
* Case statements should be indented with 4 more spaces than a switch statement!

## Positive feedback

I really like to hear that people are using my plugin. If you've got a server and have made a few quests just let me know so I can check it out ^^

## Donations

If you have some spare money and REALLY like this plugin you can donate [here](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=KG6S76KP4W6UG). This project however is not dependent on donations, so it's really optional :)
