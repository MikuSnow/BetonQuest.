# Frequently Asked Questions

If you have any questions please read it first. It's very likely that it has been already asked and answered. If not, feel free to make an Issue or a comment on any of plugin's pages across the Internet.

**Q**: _Do you have some quest samples or video tutorials?_

**A**: Unfortunatelly there's only documentation and the default quest at the moment. I will record some tutorials in the future but for now you just need to study these two sources.

**Q**: _Where is a command for creating quests?_

**A**: There is no such command, nor there will be. As of today you need to edit the files directly, I'm sorry. The process of writing advanced quests cannot be as easy as in simple Quests plugins, so it would be even harder to do it with commands. I am planning however to code a web-based editor, which would be run similarly to [Dynmap](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/dynmap/).

**Q**: _Would you add X feature?_

**A**: Check again if it's not already added. Really, go and check it [here](https://github.com/Co0sh/BetonQuest/wiki#features). I have already got 6 such requests, 3 of them where about MySQL support (which was by the way implemented right after starting the development :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:). If there is no such feature, and it doesn't involve PvP in any way then I can add it.

**Q**: _Why not PvP? :disappointed:_

**A**: I don't like it. And yes, because of that I'm terrible at it. Go and write an addon yourself.
