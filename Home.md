BetonQuest is simple, yet powerful quest plugin. It doesn't follow traditional convention, where a "quest" is a closed-structure, task-like object, which can have a set of tasks, events and rewards on completion. Instead, BetonQuest introduces net structure of objectives which can under certain conditions trigger events, start new objectives or change NPC's attitude to the player. Of course grouping this all in quests is still possible and easy (creating conversations is not though).

Advanced conditioning allows you to create more complicated quests. Requiring player to be dressed in red leather armor, holding rotten flesh in hand, in the middle of night in order to summon some demons (just an example) is not a problem. Furthermore, you can group your conditions in logic sentences, use conjunction and alternative on them, and of course negation.

BetonQuest is highly integrated with Citizens' NPCs. It uses them to deliver RPG style conversations. You don't just start a quest clicking on the NPC: you can talk with them by selecting options, just like in Baldur's Gate or Skyrim. These options can also appear only under specific conditions, so it's not a problem to create dynamic conversations.

The plugin also features an in-book journal. Have you ever played Morrowind? It's almost the same, we just reversed the order in which you see entries, so you don't have to click through hundreds of pages. Now quests don't need to display messages like "You collected every ore, now return to Miner". Instead they can update player's journal with new entry "I collected every single ore. I should return to Miner and get my reward!" That's waaay more immersive.

BetonQuest also has simple API for adding new types of objectives, conditions and events. You can make a score condition for your PvP plugin, or even objective of killing some amount of players (I don't like PvP, so I won't include this in the plugin by myself).

With RPG style conversations, in-book self updating journal and easy way of adding new functionality, BetonQuest creates the environment in which one could replicate advanced role-playing games like Skyrim or KotOR.

TL;DR - If you just skipped to this part, give up. You probably don't want to read stuff, thus you won't be able to understand the configuration of quests and conversations. Itâ€™s not so easy and predictable as in other "RPG quests" plugins.
